# BrewBro

BrewBro is a collection of useful calculators for homebrewers.  It is coded in html5/javascript, using jQuery and jQuery mobile.  

BrewBro is intended to be packaged as a mobile app using phonegap.  Currently, the project settings and structure required to build this as a phonegap app is not provided.  I'm working on it.

 - Conversion utility (Plato<->SG, F<->C)
 - Hydrometer correction
 - Refractometer calculations
 - Yeast pitch calculator
 - Carbonation (keg PSI and priming sugar) calculator
 - Water treatment calculator

Future features:
